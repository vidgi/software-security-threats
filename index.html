          <br>
          <p class="text-muted">Software bugs are a leading cause of cyber attacks and in this project, I am specifically referring to errors, flaws, mistakes, or faults in software that cause the system to behave differently than the original design. In this project, I will be focusing on the topic of Software-Based Cybersecurity Threats and Vulnerabilities. I will primarily detail technical software bugs that are exploited to the benefit of attackers and the impacts in terms of cybersecurity infrastructure. A survey of emerging threats in cybersecurity overviews a general categorization of exploitable software bugs that lead to a vast majority of cyberattacks. The most common software vulnerabilities happen as a result of exploiting software bugs in the memory, user input exploits, race conditions and user access privileges. In part 3, I will explain these vulnerabilities and give examples of how the exploit works and the subsequent impact the attack can have on a larger scale. In part 4, I will review tools and methods like effective cybersecurity frameworks, code obfuscation, reverse engineering, user input validation, checksum/integrity checks that are used as a part of a larger cybersecurity framework to find and prevent exploits from occurring. This will lead into part 5 with the social and ethical impacts of these types of vulnerabilities and methods and holistic aspects of cybersecurity, since technical topics never live in a vacuum.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Topic Rationale<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Why I picked this topic.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-muted">I believe this topic is highly important for all developers of software and related professionals to understand since it can eliminate some of the easy attacks and vulnerabilities that attackers would take advantage of. Similarly, this topic is important to me personally as I believe learning about these types of common exploits, will lead me to have a better understanding as a programmer with how to design and implement software to be guarded against these attacks. It will help me greatly to understand these basic concepts and common vulnerabilities, as this can greatly reduce the risk involved and chance for an attack to occur.</p>
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">Prior to this project, I only had a vague understanding of the area in the technical sense besides some of the memory and buffer overflow attacks mentioned in the systems course and some SQL injection attacks I learned about when I worked on the MyChart team at Epic, which were flagged as escalated issues due to their potential for endangering patient safety. Overall, I also have come to understand the impact that such attacks can cause through this class and my professional experience, and believe that further delving into the technical aspects will be beneficial for my professional and personal development. Additionally, further understanding the ethical implications of such issues, allows for a much more nuanced approach to understanding how cyberattacks can affect society as a whole.
